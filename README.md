swift-on-cloud
==============


2 Modes to be supported.

Headnode (Coaster-service passive)
N x Workers
Local - Swift instance

Headnode (Swift + Coaster-service,passive)
N x Workers

Effectively only one configuration to support ->
Coaster-service in passive mode.
Workers connect to Coaster-service in ad-hoc fashion.
Where swift runs only affects the visibility of data.
