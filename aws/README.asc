Get your Access key ID and Secret Access Key from Amazon:

Note : To create access keys, you must have permissions to perform the required
IAM actions. For more information, see Granting IAM User Permission to Manage
Password Policy and Credentials in Using IAM.

1. Go to the IAM console.

2. From the navigation menu, click Users.

3. Select your IAM user name.

4. Click User Actions, and then click Manage Access Keys.

5. Click Create Access Key.

Note: Your keys will look something like this: +
Access key ID example: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE +
Secret access key example: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY +

6. Click Download Credentials, and store the keys in a secure location.

Your secret key will no longer be available through the AWS Management Console; you will have the only copy. Keep it confidential in order to protect your account, and never email it. Do not share it outside your organization, even if an inquiry appears to come from AWS or Amazon.com. No one who legitimately represents Amazon will ever ask you for your secret key.

# Connect to the Headnode
connect headnode

list_resources
-----

To ssh to any resource listed :
[source, bash]
-----
# Specify the resource name as listed by list_resources here
# If resource_name is omitted, connect will try to connect to the
# headnode
connect <resource_name>

To stop all resources use from your local machine. Please wait for a couple of minutes
for the command to finish. Confirm that all resources have been removed using
list_resources.  :
[source, bash]
-----
# This will delete the headnode as well as all workers.
# This command will take a few minutes to execute
dissolve
# Use list_resources to check if any resources still linger
list_resource

To add more worker nodes use:
[source, bash]
-----
# The number of nodes you can create is limited by the quota's set by google.
# To increase quotas contact google using the change request form available
# under Your project / Compute engine / Quotas tab in developer console
start_n_more <Number of nodes>

# Alternatively update the configs with the total number of nodes you require
# and rerun the setup script
source setup.sh
