Swift cloud on Google Compute Engine
------------------------------------

Sign up online
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Go to Google's compute engine https://console.developers.google.com/?getstarted=https://cloud.google.com[page]
2. Create a new project and fill in the project and project id.
3. Select the project and then select compute engine from the left panel.
4. Enter billing information.

NOTE: You should sign into your google account. Once the billing info is set, you might need
    to wait a few minutes. Please note the project-name and project-id in the config file in
    the swift-on-cloud/compute-engine folder.

Setup local-machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On your local-machine setup Google's cloud SDK based on the document here:
[source,bash]
----
curl https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/release/install_google_cloud_sdk.bash | bash
# Restart bash session for the changes to kick in.
----

Authenticate via browser, by clicking the link and pasting the response to the commandline
[source,bash]
-----
gcloud auth login
-----

Get the swift-on-cloud repository from git
[source,bash]
-----
git clone git@github.com:yadudoc/swift-on-cloud.git
cd swift-on-cloud/compute-engine
-----


Manage you Cloud resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Update the file *swift-on-cloud/compute-engine/configs* in the cloned repository from the previous step,
with the following information:

 *  GCE_PROJECT : Name of project selected during the compute-engine sign up.
 *  GCE_PROJECTID : This is the unique ID for your project selected during compute-engine sign up.
 *  WORKER_MACHINE_TYPE, HEADNODE_MACHINE_TYPE: VM types for workers and headnode, choose between:
    - 'f1-micro'
    - 'g1-small'
    - 'n1-standard-<1,2,4,8>'
    - 'n1-<highmem/highcpu>-<2,4,8>'
 *  GCE_WORKER_COUNT : Number of workers to start at setup (pick a number between 1 and 20)
 *  GCE_ZONE : GCE Region to use (Multiple regions are not supported now). Choose between:
    - 'us-central1-a' and 'us-central1-b'   (with Sandy bridge processors)
    - 'europe-west1-a' and 'europe-west1-b' (with Sandy bridge processors)
    - 'asia-east1-a' and 'asia-east1-b'     (with Ivy bridge processors)

NOTE: Read more about Compute-engine zones https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/zones[here]

NOTE: GCE_WORKER_COUNT directly affects the cost. If you require more than 22 nodes including the
headnode, file a request to increase your resource quotas.

WARNING:  Do *NOT* change the images for the worker and headnode. If you use other images,
the swift components will not be present and that will result in the cluster not
functioning properly.

Start your setup:
[source, bash]
-----
# The setup.sh script must be sourced. It will start the headnode and the requested
# number of worker nodes. A swift.properties file will be generated which can be
# used by swift (0.95 and higher) to connect to the headnode started in the cloud.
# Alternatively, you could connect to the headnode by issuing "connect headnode" command
# and run on the headnode of the cluster you create.
source setup.sh
-----


Run the tutorial on the cloud
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TODO: This section is pending.


Run swift from your local machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[source, bash]
-----
# Connect to the Headnode
connect headnode
#

-----

To see resources use :
[source, bash]
-----
list_resources
-----

To ssh to any resource listed :
[source, bash]
-----
# Specify the resource name as listed by list_resources here
# If resource_name is omitted, connect will try to connect to the
# headnode
connect <resource_name>
-----

To stop all resources use:
[source, bash]
-----
# This will delete the headnode as well as all workers.
# This command will take a few minutes to execute
dissolve
-----

To add more worker nodes use:
[source, bash]
-----
# The number of nodes you can create is limited by the quota's set by google.
# To increase quotas contact google using the change request form available
# under Your project / Compute engine / Quotas tab in developer console
start_n_more <Number of nodes>

# Alternatively update the configs with the total number of nodes you require
# and rerun the setup script
source setup.sh
